    <p>Hi, I'm Belen! Let me introduce you myself a bit!
    <br>I am a first year student at Addis Ababa University and I just finished my fresh man year. I love to read fictions
    having my coffee by the side. This summer I'm trying to learn new skills online to enhance my skills. I am also here 
    trynna dive into the programming world starting off with html. I'm enjoying it so far...Other than that I have also 
    taken some courses on basics of Cybersecurity and Data analytics. I think its good to introduce mytelf to different 
    tech sectors till i know which one i want to specialize on. <br> <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
