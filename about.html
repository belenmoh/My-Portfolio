    <p>Hi, I'm Belen! Let me introduce you myself a bit!
    <br>I am a first year student at Addis Ababa University and I just finished my fresh man year. I love to read fictions
    having my coffee by the side. <img src="./images/My hobby.jpg.jpg" alt= "I enjoy reading" /> This summer I'm trying to learn 
    new skills online to enhance my skills. I am also here trynna dive into the programming world starting off with html. I'm enjoying 
    it so far...Other than that I have also taken some courses on basics of Cybersecurity and Data analytics. 
    I think its good to introduce mytelf to different tech sectors till i know which one i want to specialize on.
